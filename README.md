CRAN Task View: Web services

Maintainer:	Scott Chamberlain
Contact:	scott at ropensci.org
Version:	2013-09-09

## Introduction

This Task View contains information about using R to obtain and parse data from the web.

The base version of R ships with a wide range of functions for use within the field of environmetrics. This functionality is complemented by a plethora of packages available via CRAN, which provide specialist methods such as ordination & cluster analysis techniques. A brief overview of the available packages is provided in this Task View, grouped by topic or type of analysis. As a testament to the popularity of R for the analysis of environmental and ecological data, a special volume of the Journal of Statistical Software was produced in 2007.

If you have any comments or suggestions for additions or improvements, then please contact the maintainer of the package, not me.

A list of available packages and functions is presented below, grouped by the type of activity.
